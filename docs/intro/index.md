# 1. Introduction

"We make our world significant by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers."

â€” Carl Sagan, in Cosmos (Chapter 12), 1980.


This chapter starts with the [clinical background](#1.1-Clinical-Background), followed by the challenges in the treatment process in [workflow challenges](#1.2-Workflow-Challenges). Next, it discusses the [unmet clinical needs](#1.3-Unmet-Clinical-Needs), and ends with the research [hypothesis and the structure of the thesis](#-1.4-Hypothesis,-Contributions,-and-Structure). New terms are explained in Chapter \ref{ChapterBackground}, which readers may skip to go directly to the clinical needs in Part \ref{validationPart}, technical contributions in Part \ref{technicalPart}, and proof-of-concept experiments in Part \ref{pocPart}. A reading guide is shown in Figure \ref{fig:1.4.2structureOfThesis}.
