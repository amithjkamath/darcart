Techniques for Automation in Radiotherapy Applications
===================================

This is a WIP (Work-In-Progress): this message will be removed once sufficient progress has been made. 

TARA stands for Techniques for Automation in Radiotherapy Applications is a set of notes on AI in Radiation Oncology.

## [1: Introduction](intro/index.md)

* Clinical Background
* Workflow Challenges in Treatment Planning
* Unmet Clinical Meed for (Auto-)Contour Quality Assurance

## [2: Background](background/index.md)

* Introduction to AI
* AI Applied to the Radiotherapy Workflow

## Part I: Dosimetric Awareness of Radiation Oncology Professionals
